## Technology Stack

### NextJS

NextJS is a React framework featuring server-side rendering.

- [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)

### TailwindCSS

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

### TypeScript

This version (1.0) of the website is not actually written using TypeScript. However, the files are structured as TypeScript. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, JavaScript can be written normally until the team is ready to adopt TypeScript.

### NextUI

NextUI is a UI library for React that helps you build beautiful and accessible user interfaces. Created on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html). NextUI's primary goal is to streamline the development process, offering a beautiful and adaptable system design for an enhanced user experience. It integrates well with NextJS.
